# TreatmentWim

I had to work a lot with the customizable Windows 10 image, and .wim was a chore and time consuming. Therefore, I decided to develop my own tool for working with .wim files.

The application is able to capture an overview from a file on the VHD disk, mount and unmount a wim on a local disk, add an answer file and a customized start menu file, import boot.wim and install.wim to a folder with an image, convert wim to .esd and compress it. Also, the program can assemble a ready-made ISO file intended for installation.
